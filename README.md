# My protfolio Viewer

This Website built for educational purposes, and I designed the site to 
make information about myself and to view easily accessible, to allow people 
to see my works and offers to collaborate with various companies around the globe.

This portfolio provides information about my services, including about my page, 
contact information, resume, and even takes into consideration both international
users and local users. So it has both English and Swedish versions.

This site developed as a prototype that can be used right after school, just add some future technology. 
That is why it already has all the features of my existing services offered.
It is a one-stop-shop for me to show my branding and build a profile on my skills and attributes.

### Ux

![Responsive Views of Home Page]

### Users 

The project is intended to show information about myself and my brand. 
The site layout is exquisite and simple. It is responsive and can be easily
navigate across all types of devices. The user lands on the Home page, 
where they can navigate to an about me page, resume, services, and contact information.
This project can replicate by anyone interested in building something similar.

### User Stories
1. A user wants to show the services to anyone who wants to work together and build something special together.
2. A professional education user wants to share learning resources with other developers.
3. As a recruiter user, I want more information about the person and want to see if he/she is capable enough for hiring or collaboration.
4. For any company that recruits users seeking information and services, <br>
   it must have some specific information to reach the person quickly via social media and direct phone.
5. As users of this site, it must be easy to navigate, and the pages should be appealing on all devices.

## Deployment

The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages] (https://github.com/YOSTINA-dh/My-Portfolio)

The process involved:
- Host a git repository on GitHub.
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files
- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)
- Provided link will be your projects home (index) page.
 
To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the [repository]([https://github.com/YOSTINA-dh/My-Portfolio)
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository
    - ```git clone https://github.com/Yostina-dh/My-Portfolio-ifd-project.git```
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
    - Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser
- Visit the link provided
- Your website with any made changes will appear
- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.

During development the site is written in VS Code. It is run using Live Server plugin for VS Code.
