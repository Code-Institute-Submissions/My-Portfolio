## Introduction

My Portfolio is a responsive design Website.

I designed the Website to make information about myself and to view easily accessible, to allow people to see my works and offers, even to collaborate with individuals and various companies around the globe. The portfolios present:
* Personal Information
* Working History
* Educational Background 
* Services
* Offers
* Contact Information
* Language alternative


The primary purpose of the website is to show the services and offers, even to make myself a brand. That is why it already has all the features of my existing services. Any companies HR-Recruiter or individual users can easily find the Contact button both in the menu bar and at the bottom of the page.

It is a one-stop-shop for me to show my branding and build a profile on my skills and attributes.

It also takes into account both international users and local users. So it has both English and Swedish versions.

The site is responsive and can be easily navigate in any type of device.

The stand out colour for this web page is Light grayish red and white. The reason I choose this color is that I'm just a color-loving person, and I want to reflect on my websites, one of my favorite color.


#### Font

The Fonts I used for this project are **Josefin Sans**  with the font weights: 
* 14px- for most of the subtext.
* 16px/bold - for headers and titles.   

The [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans) the font was chosen for its looking good on all types of devices.

### Wireframes

I decided that it would be more helpful to have mockups than simple wireframes. The mockups were done in [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Features
### Existing Features

#### Elements seen on every page

* **Layout and Style**
    * Before jumping into my project I researched different layout and structure for a single portfolio website, and I noticed that most portfolio pages were very loaded, more animated and used too many languages, so I decided that mine would be classic and simple according to my short term code experience.

* **Navigation bar**
    * Has a `fixed` position to ensure that the user can access it at any time.
    * My Portfolio and brand name in the left corner which also serves as a link to go back to the landing page. (assets/images/logo.jpg)

* **Footer**
    * Copyright information.

* **Images**
    * one of the images has a light gray red floating effect

#### Other elements

* **Landing page**
    * Has images and text. A text represents the images, and it can change the color when `hover` or clicked on. 

* **About Me page**
    * Has a box-text with`hover` and an image showing a piece of information.

* **Resume page**
    * Has two columns loaded with work experience and educational background.
    
* **Service pages**
    * Has four boxes filled by available services and used a beautiful hover effect used.

## User testing

### My Mentor

* She helped me from the beginning  of the project to the end. For instance,
    * To change the burger menu  size and color.
    * Fix the size of the carousel and to make it full size.
    * Create quale distance between all sections border radius begins (seat), so that the border and content isn't making contact 
    * Reduce the size of the image on the About me image and the box.
    * Fix the size of about section @ media issue for desktop screen sizes - I tried to solve the problem but but is not solved as she recommend - will look at in future releases.

### Bugs and Fixes for Future Releases After Testing

* **@media** -  After the last session of this project with my mentor, I realize that I still facing to fix the image and the floating effect box on the about section. I think this can be addressed by writing additional CSS for future releases.
* **Colour Contrasts** - The colours used on the site are too similar and could cause an issue for accessability. These issues will be addressed in the next release.
* **Social Media Links in Footer** - The social media icons are linked to the correct pages, however these are currently generic login pages. These will direct you to the company specific pages in future releases.
* **Desktop Lanscape View** - On some home page, when viewing on a desktop in Carousel, has a different result. This will be fixed on the next release.
* **Bootstrap Carousel** - Not happy with the size of the pictures. It should have to be looking great in a professional way,  Just add a certain future that will make it look good. I think this can be handled by writing additional styling and floating for future releases.
