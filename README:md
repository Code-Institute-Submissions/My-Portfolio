# MY protofolio Viewer

This Website built for educational purposes, and I designed the site to 
make information about myself and to view easily accessible, to allow people 
to see my works and offers to collaborate with various companies around the globe.

This portfolio provides information about my services, including about my page, 
contact information, resume, and even takes into consideration both international
users and local users. So it has both English and Swedish versions.

This site developed as a prototype that can be used right after school, just add some future technology. 
That is why it already has all the features of my existing services offered.
It is a one-stop-shop for me to show my branding and build a profile on my skills and attributes.

UX

The project is intended to show information about myself and my brand. 
The site layout is exquisite and simple. It is responsive and can be easily
navigate across all types of devices. The user lands on the Home page, 
where they can navigate to an about me page, resume, services, and contact information.
This project can replicate by anyone interested in building something similar.
